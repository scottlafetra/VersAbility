# Vers-Ability

*Version 0.1*

A game by Andrew DiLullo

Vers-Ability is a 2 - 4 player arena based game in which characters fight for dominance and opportunity.

The game can be played with two people competing 1v1 or 2v2 in which each controls two characters, but the heart of the game is with 4 players, wither in the style of 2v2 teams, or a 4 player free-for-all. Each character will start with a couple basic actions to work with, but that alone will not be enough to triumph in the arena. Over the course of the game, you will need to expand your array of attacks, actions, and defenses to both Adapt and Overcome your opponents.

## Game Setup Reference Guide

*This is much more helpful after you have read the rules*

Each player starts with a 12 card deck, a class card, and that class's Starting Actions on their Action Tablet. After teams and turn order are decided, players place their character markers on the board, then each player suffles their 12 card deck and draws a 3 card starting hand.

On a player's turn, their character's AP increases by 1. Each character may move up to 3 places per turn, performing any Actions they have access to and can afford.

## Components

- Game Board
- Action Cards
- Equipment and Reaction Cards
- Class Cards
- Starting Actions
- Condition Cards and Fatigue tokens
- Dice (*lots*)
- Character Tokens
- Trap Tokens

## Movement and Terrain

On any character's turn, they can move up to **three** spaces. When moving, characters travel from one space to an adjacent one. In this game, adjacent refers to any space connected fully on a side, not a corner. Players also cannot move through obstacles OR players.

Characters can freely perform actions between movements.

Some spaces on the board are specially marked.

Characters start the game on a Starting Space of their choice. Afterwards it becomes a regular blank space.

Diamonds are small obstacles.
Cross spaces are large obstacles.

Any player that ends their turn while standing on the Reward Space draws a free card before passing the turn.

## Class Cards and Action Points (**AP**)

Each player chooses one of many different possible classes, represented by a Class Card.

### Health

This is both your character's starting health as well as their maximum.

### Starting Actions

Every class starts with 1 - 2 unique starting actions. Place 1 copy of each action listed here in your Action Tablet.

### Character Art

...eventually

### Class Ability

Class abilities are constantly in effect. In addition to class abilities, each class will also have access to empowered actions. *(pg. v)*

### Action Points

You start the game with 0 AP (Action Points), which is kept track with a pair of 8-sided dies *(Provided)*, or whatever method you prefer.

At the start of each turn, you gain 1 AP. Your AP maxes out at 8.

In order to use an action, you need to be able to pay that action's AP cost. Doing so reduces your current AP *(shown in red)*.

Your max AP *(shown in blue)* remains the same, regardless of how much AP you spend.

Finally, when your next turn starts and your AP increases, your current AP resets back to your max AP. Every turn gives you fresh resources, which also means leftover AP doesn't carry between turns either.

## Card Zones

There are 4 diffrent places where cards can exist: Deck, Hand, Action Tablet and Discard.

### Deck

Each deck consists of 12 cards. **At the start of the game, shuffle your deck and draw 3 cards.**

In addition to increasing your AP at the start of your turn, you eill also draw 1 card from here.

### Hand

Your hand consists of the 3 cards you draw at the start, as well as all cards you draw from your deck.

Your hand has a card limit of 4. At the end of your turn, if you have more than 4 cards, you must choose cards to discard until you reach 4.

### Action Tablet

The Action Tablet contains all the cards you are capable of using on your turns. Cards in your hand can't be used until you place them in your Tablet, with the exception of Reactions *(pg. 10)*.

Your Tablet has a card limit of 3. If your Tablet EVER has more than 3 cards, you must choose cards to discard until you have 3. **All cards inthe Action Tablet must have different names.**

In addition to your tablet, you also have one Equipment Slot *(pg. 10)*.

This works the same as the Tablet: if you have more than 1 Equipment, you must discard until only one remains.

### Discard

Cards that overflow your hand or are discarded for other reasons end up in your Discard pile faceup. These cards normally cannot be accessed.

## Actions

Most interaction of this game comes in the form of Actions.

### Class Icon

This only appears if the card is a Starting Action

### Action Type

Currently either "Attack" or "Focus". Attack actions deal damage; Focus actions can perform a wide cariety of effects.

### Effect Type

Attacks will always list "Damage" and the base amount.

Focus can be "Empower" for benifical effects, "Sabotage" for negitive effects, or "Heal" for effects that directly recover health *(as well as a base amount)*.

### Damage Type
If it's an Attack, deals either Physical, Magical, or Absolute. If it's a focus, this will be left blank.

### Range
Melee can only target characters on adjacent squares. Self can only target the currently active character.

Ranged list a min and max range. Your target must be within that many spaces of you. **You cannot target people through Large Obstructions OR Other Characters.**

### Effect Box
If the Action has any additionall effects, they will be listed here, this box occasionally contains "flavor text" in *italics*, which has no effect on the action.

### Empowered Action
Some actions have specific classes listed in their Effect Box. Any effects under a class provide the listed benefits for that particular class.

This is called an "Empowered Action"


The only actions characters have access to are the ones in their Action Tablet as well as two universal actions: **Adapt** and **Study**.

### Adapt - 0 AP
Place a card from your hand onto your Action Tablet
**The main way to fill up your tablet**

### Study - 2 AP
Draw 1 card from your Deck.
**Another way to fill up your hand.**

While there is no limit to how many total Actions you can use in a turn, **each individual Action can only be used once per turn. This includes Adapt and Study.**

"Once per turn" limit on Actions takes into account the name of the action, not the card. 

*Example: Using "Longshot" and replacing it with another copy of "Longshot" will not allow you to use that Action a second time.*

This means that when your AP starts reaching higher values, the only way to effectivly use it all is by equipping yourself with a wide range of "Vers-Ability".

## Critical and Guard Rolls

Whenever a character is attacked by a Physical or Magical attack, each player rolls a 6-sided die to see how much they can influence the attack.

The Offense makes a "Crit Roll". 

If the dice result is a 5 or higher, it is considered a "Critical Hit", or "Crit".

On a Crit, the damage delt is increased by 10.

The Defense makes a "Guard Roll".

If the dice result is 5 or higher, it is considered a "Gaurd".

On a guard, the damage delt is decreased by 10.

If both players succeed their rolls, then both effects happen.

In most cases, this means the +10 bonus is cancelled out by the -10 reduction.
However, there are many Actions that have additional interactions involving Critical Hits.

If an attack deals Absolute damage, no dice are rolled on either side unless stated. In most cases, Absolute is fixed and cannot be influenced.

## Equipment and Reactions

In additon to Actions, there are also Equipment and Reaction cards.

Equipment goes in your Equipment Slot. Instead of activating them for benefits like Actions, Equipment are always active.

You place equipment on your Equipment Slot using "Adapt", but Adapt's AP most is replaced with the Equipment's "Star Level".

**Reaction cards are unique in that they can only be played on other player's turns.**

Because of these odd restrictions, Reaction cards can be played with no inital cost, but do require you to discard the card after use, and can only be played in reaction to certain types of actions. The **React Type** will tell you what cards they can be used against.

Be aware: As well as discarding the Reaction card, many Reactions will also require you to pay additional costs.

## Deck Construction

Each deck contains exactly 12 cards. Each deck is limited to the following:

You may have as many different Reaction and Equipment cards as you want, but you may only have 1 of each.

Same is true for acitons, but instead you may have up to 2 copies of each.

Some classes have abilites that modify deck construction.

## Fatigue and Conditions

If at any time you would need to draw or reveal cards from your deck and your deck is empty, shuffle your discard facedown and make that your new deck.

Unfortunatly, each time this hapens you gain 4 stacks of fatigue. You might also gain stacks of fatigue from certain actions. Fatigue stacks don't do anything individually, but will start penalizing you in large amounts.

If you have 4 or more stacks, you are "Exhausted", which increased the cost of Adapt and Study by 1 AP each.

If you have 8 or more stacks, you are "Drained", causing you to pass out. **If this happens you are knocked out.**

Some Actions have the opportunity to inflict Conditions on your target.

Every Condition comes with a constant effect on the player, and each includes a means to "cure" that condition.

If a condition is cured, tap it instead of removing it. At the start of your turn, discard all of your cured conditions.

While a codition is cured, it no longer affects you, but more importantly you cannot regain a condition while you have an active or cured version of it already.

## Turn Order and FAQ

In order to determine turn order, each player rolls a die. The turn order is highest to lowest.

If you are playing 2v2, highest roll goes first, highest roll on the opposite team goes second, teammate of highest roll goes third and remaining player is last. Basicly:

*A1, B1. A2, B2*

In teams, if a player is knocked out or drained, his partner takes his place in the turn order:

If player A2 is knocked out: *A1, B1, A1, B2*

--------------------

Here's a list of Fequently Asked Questions. If anything comes to your mind, please contact Andrew DilLullo and let him know.

*Q: Magic Missle says on Crit, damage changes to Absolute. Does my opponent still roll for Gaurd?*

*A: As soon as the damage type becomes Absolute, no more rolls are made. That means the Critical effects go through, but a Guard Roll isn't made.*

*Q: Does by deck need to have Equipment or Reaction cards in it?*

*A: Not at all. Your deck could be 12 diffrent action cards, or even 2 copies of 6 actions.*
