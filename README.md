## A game by Andrew DiLullo

Vers-Ability is a two player arena based game in which characters fight for dominance and opportunity.

The game can be played with two people competing 1v1 or 2v2 in which each controls two characters, but the heart of the game is with 4 players, wither in the style of 2v2 teams, or a 4 player free-for-all. Each character will start with a couple basic actions to work with, but that alone will not be enough to triumph in the arena. Over the course of the game, you will need to expand your array of attacks, actions, and defenses to both Adapt and Overcome your opponents.
